# Chapter 2: Variables, expressions, and statements

## 2.1 Values and types
 1. __values__ are something a program works with. _ex. 1,2 , 'Hello'_
 2. __types__
    * _integer_
    * _string_
    * _float_
    * _etc_
3. find the type of an object with _type_
```python
type('Hello, World!')
type(4000)
```
## 2.2 Variables
1. You can assign variables
```python
message = 'everyone for themselves!!!!'
n = 17 
pi = 3.141592
```
2. You can use a state diagram to convey variable assignment on paper. 

## 2.3 Variable names and keywords
1. choose names that are meaningful. 
2. varibles have to begin with a number. 
3. It is better to start a variable with a lowercase letter. 
4. Invalid names will give you syntax errors. 
    * 18banannas --> starts with a number
    * frequenttrips@ --> has the @ symbol
    * class --> used by Python as keyword

## 2.4 Operators and operands
1. __Operators__ are symbols that represent computation like... + / - = 
2. __operands__ are vales acted on by the _operators_
3. '^' is known as XOR in Python
4. Python 2 has 31 protected keywords
    * and
    * as 
    * assert
    * break
    * class 
    * continue
    * def
    * del
    * elif
    * else
    * except
    * exec
    * finally
    * for 
    * from 
    * global
    * if 
    * import
    * in 
    * is
    * lambda
    * not 
    * or 
    * pass
    * print
    * raise
    * return 
    * try 
    * while
    * with 
    * yield 
5. In Python 3, the result of a division is a _float_. The new '//' operator performs floor division. 


## 2.5 Expressions and statements 
1. __expression__ is a combination of values, variables, and operators. 
2. a __statement__ is a unit of code that a Python interpreter can execute. 

## 2.6 Interactive mode and script mode
Interactive mode, such as being in the pyton command line intepretor is not the same as script mode. Using the command line interpreter calculator functions will not work the same when you run the same commands as a script. 

## 2.7 Order of operations
1. Order follows __rules of precedence__. 
2. Order of operations follows the acronym __PEMDAS__
    * _Parenthesis_
    * _Exponentiation_
    * _Multiplication and Division is greater than Addition and Subtraction
    * Operators with the same precendence moves left to right.
