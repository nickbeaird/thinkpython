# Chapter 1 - The way of the program
https://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf


## 1.1 Python Programming Language
1. Python is a high level language.
2. Python is an interpreted language. __compilers__ and __interpreters__ are needed to convert high level languages into low level languages. _interpreters_ read a langueage and executes it. A _compiler_ willn translate the language before executing it creating an _object code_. 
3. Python scripts end in .py

## 1.2 What is a program?
1. A __program__ is a sequence of instructions. 
2. Terinology: 
    * __input__: Get data from keyboard, file, or device. 
    * __output__: Duplay data or send data. 
    * __math__: perform math operations. 
    * __conditional execution__: check for conditions. 
    * __repetition__: perform some action repeatedly. 

## 1.3 Debugging
1. Errors in code are bugs. 
2. The original computer issues were found to be physical bugs in the hardware. 
3. __Syntax errors__: How an issues is written. 
4. __Runtime errors__: An error after a program has starte running. 
5. __semantic errors:__ When a program does something other than intended. 
6. _Learning to debug_ is a thought procress and way of being. 

## 1.4 Formal and natural languages
1. Python is a formal language.
2. Formal and natural languages differ by _ambiguitiy_, _redundancy_, and _literalness_.
3. Figuring out the structure of a sentence is _parsing_. 

## 1.5 The First Language
```python
print('Hello World!')
```

## 1.6 Debugging
1. when learning test the examples. 
2. We respond to computers like people. When things are going well we treat them as teammates. When thhings are going poorly we get mad at them. _take some time_
